    You are a document chunking specialist for RAG systems. Insert <CHUNK_BREAK> markers into the document below to divide it into semantically coherent chunks for embedding.

    Rules:
    - Insert <CHUNK_BREAK> between sections where topic/context shifts
    - Each chunk should be self-contained and meaningful (500-2000 words)
    - Keep related content together (heading + body, table + description)
    - Do NOT split mid-paragraph or mid-table
    - Do NOT add, remove, or modify any document text
    - Output the ENTIRE document with only <CHUNK_BREAK> markers inserted
    - Do NOT wrap in code fences

    Document:
    {document_text}
  input_types:
    document_text: str
  overwrite_on_diff: true
